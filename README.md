# CryptidFinder
Cryptid is a tabletop game by Osprey Games in which 3 to 5 players are trying to be the one to find the location of a cryptid.

The idea behind this project on here was to find out if there are more than one answer to a map.  Also more of a challenge to myself to see if I could make a program to accurately find the location of the cryptid given a set of rules and map layout.  

General Overview:
* A map consists of 6 tiles placed in rows of 2
* Each tile consists of 3 rows of 6 hexagons
* Each player has a different rule book that contains 96 possible rules for where the cryptid could be
  * Each map will list the associated rule per player to use
